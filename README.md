## Code Patches
All related files for code patching to be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/JpJTgQCJ#0vigu87XxWC-uqVBkvkceQ).

We made code patches to the game to patch texts located inside the code.bin, patch the cpk loading routine, and patch all manner of line and image positions.
To apply the code changes in the .asm file we used `armips.exe` by Kingcom [here](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips).
